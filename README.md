# INSTALL: 
Move a script somewhere in your Assets directory and then add it to the Game Object that you want it to trigger on. Then configure any variables that the script may have.

# DISCLAIMER: 
Not all of these might work 100% as intended except for the Universal Decals, DeadzoneVolume, KillVolume, LandscapeHoleVolume, FlickeringLight, and BlinkingLight scripts. These scripts only reference precompiled scripts in-game so making modifications to them will not change anything in-game and may even break the script. These are not the only scripts that this technique works on, I just thought that these were the most important one and that you should be able to find and edit down other working scripts to a usable state using these ones as examples.
